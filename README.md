# shellycloudhass

This is an attempt at polling Shelly H&T devices over cloud to Home Assistant.

You should really use the official Shelly integration. This one is just a hack for HACS, and only supports H&T sensors over the cloud.

# installation

Add this to HACS as a custom integration repository. Add the shellycloud integration to HA. Provide the token from the Shelly Cloud UI and use your own server name based on your location.
